        <h3>Fertiliy is our Game!</h3>
        <p>
        Our purpose at Spolidoro Beefmaster is to breed cattle that are Hardy, Long lasting, Fertile, and Adaptable to any region. 
        This makes our cows perfect affordable purchases for emerging farmers. We sell our animals at ages from 14 months onwards 
        because our animals are early maturing meaning our bulls are ready to work at 16 months with a limited number of cows.<br><br>

        Emerging farmers don't have large amounts of land, which means they need 
        efficient animals with high productivity to ensure they get the most out of their limited resources. <br><br>
            
        Since 2000 we have always focused on the figures of our animals and year by year we have slowly built up
        the herd keeping only our own bloodline which kept the genetics pure and our figures at the highest level.
